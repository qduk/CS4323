# CS4323
To run program in the state it is, we decided to create a bash script that compiles all of our c files and then runs them. All you should need to do, in our root directory folder of CS4323 is run `./compile.sh`. You'll then get warnings for pthread compiling (which we will fix later) and output from all of our threads.
